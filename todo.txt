GUI
	Main Application
		Black screen
	Each element has a GUI
	
Firespread mechanics
	Implement function for calculating probability the adjacent cell will be on fire based on:
			height differential
			wind speed & direction
			volatility - how much burnable material is in the cell

Colormap conversion
	Implement function for generating working maps from a color map
			height map		topological
			volatility map	google images (more green = more volatile)

Global wind speed & direction
		dynamic or static?
